Practice Race-Day Conditions: Simulate race-day conditions (clothing, nutrition) on longer training runs.
Strength Training for Ultra Success

Don't underestimate the power of strength training:

Focus on Major Muscle Groups: Strengthen legs (squats, lunges), core (planks, crunches), and upper body (push-ups, rows) for improved power and injury prevention.

Mountain Poles: Friend or Foe?
Mountain poles are a hotly debated topic in the ultramarathon community. Here's a breakdown of their pros and cons:

Benefits:

Improved Balance and Stability: Especially beneficial on descents, poles help maintain balance and reduce stress on knees and ankles.
Increased Upper Body Engagement: Poles distribute effort across more muscle groups, reducing fatigue in legs and core.
Enhanced Efficiency: On climbs, poles can propel you forward, particularly on loose terrain like gravel or sand.
Improved Posture: Proper pole technique encourages good posture, reducing upper back and neck strain.
Drawbacks:

Learning Curve: Mastering proper technique takes practice to avoid inefficiency or discomfort.
Extra Weight: Poles add a small amount of weight, which might be a concern for minimalist runners.
Storage and Handling: Poles need to be managed during aid stations or technical sections.
Not for Everyone: Some runners find poles hinder their rhythm or create arm fatigue.
The Verdict:

Ultimately, the decision to use poles is personal. Experiment during training runs on different terrains and see if they enhance your comfort and performance.

Fueling the Ultra Machine: Nutrition Strategies
Proper nutrition fuels your ultra journey. Here are key principles:
